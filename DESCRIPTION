Description: Survey systems and other third-party data sources commonly use non-standard representations of logical values when
    it comes to qualitative data - "Yes", "No" and "N/A", say. batman is a package designed to seamlessly convert these into logicals.
    It is highly localised, and contains equivalents to boolean values in languages including German, French, Spanish, Italian,
    Turkish, Chinese and Polish.
