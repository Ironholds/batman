Description: Survey systems and other third-party data sources commonly use non-
    standard representations of logical values when it comes to qualitative data -
    "Yes", "No" and "N/A", say. batman is a package designed to seamlessly convert
    these into logicals. It is highly localised, and contains equivalents to boolean
    values in languages including German, French, Spanish, Italian, Turkish, Chinese
    and Polish.
