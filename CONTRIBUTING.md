## How to contribute

The most useful contribution, other than bugfixes, is translations.

If you speak a language other than English, and are familiar with common equivalents to TRUE/FALSE or yes/no, submit those equivalents! The really easy way is to [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Ironholds/batman/issues) with your translations - the more complicated way is forking the package, taking a look at the categorical_booleans structure, adding your translations to that, and submitting a pull request.

As examples of the idiomatic usage we see, current english-language values are, for TRUE:

    y
    yes
    t
    true
    1

And for FALSE:

    n
    no
    f
    false
    0
    none
    
The idiomatic bit is key; if you see something commonly in survey data, whether it's precisely equivalent to "true" linguistically or not is moot - we'd like to have it.

All contributors get listed in the DESCRIPTION file; additionally, the first few will (if they want) get free stickers, which is nice.
